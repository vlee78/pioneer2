This sample uses MRuby.

* Install the SDL2 libraries and include files.

* Install MRuby (https://github.com/mruby/mruby) and mruby-sdl2 (https://github.com/crimsonwoods/mruby-sdl2).

The installation of mruby-sdl2 may be tricky, and may involve recompiling mruby while adding this line to build_config.rb:

  conf.gem :github => 'crimsonwoods/mruby-sdl2', :branch => 'master'

Consult the mruby-sdl2 project for more information.

* Run the SDL2 sample with "mruby main.rb".
